# Java Spring Mastery Roadmap — Progressive Guide

**Goal:** Take you from Java fundamentals through advanced Spring ecosystems and microservices — with practical tasks, tools, libraries, and project ideas that make you job-ready.

---

## How to use this roadmap

1. Work stage-by-stage, **only move on** after completing the "Milestone" items for a stage.
2. Keep everything in Git (feature branches + meaningful commits). Deploy at least one idea from each stage (progressive deployments look great on a CV).
3. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) for services and add integration tests using Testcontainers.
4. Build one **capstone project** (see Stage 13) that combines most stages: DB, security, messaging, observability, CI/CD.

---

# Job-ready Checklist & Interview Prep

**Technical skills to highlight**

* Clean REST API design, Spring Boot projects, Spring Data, Transaction management
* Security knowledge: JWT, OAuth2 basics, role-based access
* Test coverage: unit + integration using Testcontainers
* Experience with containers, Docker, Kubernetes basics, CI/CD
* Observability experience: metrics, logs, tracing

**Portfolio & interview tasks**

* 2–3 polished projects with README, deployment instructions, and screenshots
* A recorded 10–15 minute walkthrough (optional) demonstrating architecture and code
* Prepare for system design: design a microservice for X (e.g., order system) — practice diagrams and reasoning about consistency, scaling, and failure modes
* Prepare behavioral / situational answers around debugging, trade-offs, and past mistakes

**Common tech questions to practice**

* Explain DI and Spring bean lifecycle, difference between @Component and @Bean
* How does Spring Boot autoconfiguration work? What is `spring.factories` or auto-configuration metadata?
* JPA: explain lazy loading & N+1 problem; how to fix it
* Explain OAuth2 flows; JWT pros/cons; refresh tokens
* How do you scale a microservice? How to do blue-green or canary deploys?

---

# Learning workflow & daily practice suggestions

* Build: pick focused 1–2 week mini-projects that exercise a stage
* Read: official Spring docs and read source for small modules
* Test: pair TDD with shallow and deep tests
* Review: get code reviews from peers or mentors; open-source contributions add credibility
* Repeat: refactor a completed project (e.g., convert monolith -> microservices, add caching, add events)

---

# Final tips

* Keep things pragmatic: learn by building—each concept should be applied in a mini feature.
* Focus on observable improvements: show how metrics changed after performance tuning.
* Document architecture decisions in your repo; employers love clear READMEs and diagrams.
